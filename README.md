# usercontent

So the main reason for the repository is that I recently followed the Firefox Privcy Guide from 12bytes.org - https://12bytes.org/articles/tech/firefox/the-firefox-privacy-guide-for-dummies/

however I found that some ads would still come through and other cookie notices would not go away, so in order to make my browsing just that bit more easier I decided to implement the userContent css in firefox.

For this to work you have go to about:config and set
toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets preference to true.

this sureuser guide explains the process https://superuser.com/questions/318912/how-can-i-override-the-css-of-a-site-in-firefox-with-usercontent-css.

[
1.Open Firefox and press Alt to show the top menu, then click on Help â†’ Troubleshooting Information

2.Click the Open Folder button beside the Profile Folder entry

3.Create a folder named chrome in the directory that opens

4.In the chrome folder, create a CSS file with the name userContent.css

]

And just use the usercontent.css in this repository to get you started.

I will try to update it whenever I update it through my own browsing use.

Enjoy!
